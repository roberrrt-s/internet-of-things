# Festireport
#### A toolkit to develop your own monitoring system for crowded area's

##### Introduction

Festireport is an experimental toolkit in discovering a way to measure the amount and intensity of people at large gatherings (such as festivals). It involves a combination of sensors, a dashboard and a small NodeMCU chip that uses the sensors to measure several forms of data. This prototype will not make use of all those sensors, but will depend on a potentiometer to establish an idea of a 'crowd'

##### Requirements

 - Hardware
 	- NodeMCU ESP8266
 	- A set of male-male connectors
 	- A set of female-female connectors
 	- A breadboard to connect internally
 	- 3 LED lights.
 	- A Potentio (POT) meter.

 - Software
 	- Arduino SDK
 	- Webserver running PHP
 	- Text editor (I personally use Sublime)
 	- FTP client
